    <p>I was born in Baltimore, Maryland and grew up in Towson.
        <br>I am a freshmam here at Syracuse and so far I really enjoy my time here.
        <br> Some hobbies that I enjoy are skiing, watching and playing baseball and football and tracking severe weather.
        <br>A fun fact is that I have a twin who took this class as well.</p>
